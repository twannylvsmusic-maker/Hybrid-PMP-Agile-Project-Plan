# Portfolio Update Guide - Project Consolidation

## ðŸŽ¯ **Current Situation**
The new **Hybrid PMP + Agile Project Management System** now includes the capabilities that were previously demonstrated in the **Onboarding Framework** project. This creates an opportunity to consolidate and streamline your portfolio.

## ðŸ“‹ **Option 1: Remove Onboarding Framework Project**

### **Steps to Remove:**
1. **Delete the project file**: `projects/onboarding-framework.html`
2. **Update main portfolio page**: Remove link to Onboarding Framework
3. **Update navigation**: Remove from featured projects menu
4. **Clean up references**: Remove any mentions in other portfolio pages

### **Benefits:**
- âœ… **Cleaner portfolio** with no duplicate capabilities
- âœ… **Focus on the enhanced system** that includes onboarding features
- âœ… **Simplified navigation** for visitors
- âœ… **More space** for other projects

---

## ðŸ“‹ **Option 2: Rename & Reposition Onboarding Framework**

### **Rename Options:**
1. **"Process Improvement Framework"** - Broader scope
2. **"Business Process Optimization"** - Generic business focus
3. **"Six Sigma Process Analysis"** - Focus on methodology
4. **"Gap Analysis Framework"** - Focus on the core capability

### **Repositioning Strategy:**
- **Keep the project** but make it more generic
- **Remove PMP/Agile references** that overlap with new system
- **Focus on Six Sigma methodology** and gap analysis
- **Position as a separate tool** for general business process improvement

---

## ðŸ“‹ **Option 3: Merge & Reference**

### **Hybrid Approach:**
1. **Keep Onboarding Framework** as a separate project
2. **Add reference** in new system: "Includes capabilities from our Onboarding Framework"
3. **Cross-link projects** to show evolution
4. **Position as complementary** rather than overlapping

---

## ðŸŽ¯ **Recommended Approach: Option 1 (Remove)**

### **Rationale:**
- The new **Hybrid Project Management System** is more comprehensive
- It includes all onboarding framework capabilities plus much more
- Removes confusion about which system to use
- Showcases the evolution and improvement of your work

### **Update Steps:**

#### **1. Update Main Portfolio Page**
Remove or comment out the Onboarding Framework link:
```html
<!-- Remove this section -->
<div class="project">
    <h3>Onboarding Framework</h3>
    <p>Prompt-driven evaluation template...</p>
    <a href="projects/onboarding-framework.html">View Project</a>
</div>
```

#### **2. Update Navigation Menu**
Remove from featured projects menu if it exists.

#### **3. Update Project Count**
Adjust any counters or statistics that reference total number of projects.

#### **4. Archive Option**
Instead of deleting, you could:
- Move to `archive/onboarding-framework.html`
- Add note: "Capabilities now included in Hybrid Project Management System"
- Keep for historical reference but don't feature
