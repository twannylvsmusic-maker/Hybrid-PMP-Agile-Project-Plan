Power BI Setup — Hybrid Project Plan

What you'll do:
1) In Power BI Desktop, Get Data → **Folder** → point to:
   REPLACE_WITH_FULL_PATH/Hybrid_ProjectPlan_Package/automation/weekly_csvs
   - Paste the M code for 'Weekly Updates' from Queries_M_Code.txt if you want exact schema.
2) Get Data → **Excel** → select:
   REPLACE_WITH_FULL_PATH/Hybrid_ProjectPlan_Package/Hybrid_ProjectPlan_Template.xlsx
   - Import sheets: WBS_TaskPlan, Risk_Issue_Log, Project_Overview (and Sprint_Planner if desired).
3) Open **DAX_Measures.txt**, create a **Calendar** table and paste the measures in a new measures table.
4) Create relationships:
   - Weekly Updates[Week Start] → Calendar[Date]
   - (Optional) other date fields to Calendar if added.
5) Apply the theme: View → **Browse for themes** → select theme_github_portfolio.json
6) Build visuals:
   - Line chart: Date vs CSAT (Avg CSAT); add a slicer for last 4 weeks.
   - Clustered columns: Tickets Opened vs Resolved by Week.
   - Card visuals: TTV (days), High Risk Count, Backlog Points Total.
   - Table: Risk_Issue_Log with conditional formatting when Score > 1.5.
7) Refresh:
   - Place weekly CSVs into `automation/weekly_csvs` (or use Python automation to update Excel too).
   - Click **Refresh** in Power BI to update visuals.

Notes:
- Replace all REPLACE_WITH_FULL_PATH with your actual absolute path.
- Save your PBIX into the project folder for convenience.
